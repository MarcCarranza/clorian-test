## Structure 🏗️

I've tried to atomize the code as much as possible while keeping it tidy and manageable, with a standard folder structure inside /src:

- mocks
- tests
- app
- components
- constants
- data
- helpers
- hooks
- redux
- types

## Functionality 💽

Apart from the functionalities asked, I've implemented a loader for the data fetching and the possibility of removing items individually.
